    <h1>The Story of the 2017 New York Yankees</h1>
    <h2>Gregory Csak</h2>

    <p> The 2017 season was a rollercoaster of emotions. During this time period the Yankees were not winning in previous years. Their last “successful” season was 2012. Going into the 2017 season the expectations were pretty low for this team. With veteran players retiring and some still on the team, and a mixture of young players who had yet to prove their full potential, many expected this team to not go very far. A few young players came onto the scene in 2016 such as pitcher Luis Severino, catcher Gary Sanchez, and outfielder Aaron Judge. Judge and Severino did not perform all that well in their brief time in the majors, however that was the opposite for Sanchez who came up to the big leagues in mid-August and went on to hit 20 home runs in 53 games and nearly won the Rookie of the Year award. But many were scratching their heads going into 2017 with many questions. Will Sanchez have another good year, or was 2016 a fluke? Will Judge and Severino make an impact on this team after last years struggles? The media and fans were anxious to know.</p>

            The Yankees continued to win, and win, and win. On September 23rd against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Yankees officially put themselves into the 2017 postseason. Before the season started this team was not projected to make the playoffs, but they proved everyone wrong. The regular season ended on October 1st. In a 162-game season the Yankees finished with a record of 91-71. It was their first 90-win season since 2012 when they won 95 games. Going back to the young stars, Aaron Judge hit 52 home runs, at the time it was the most home runs in a season by a rookie. Gary Sanchez finished the year with 33 home runs, and pitcher Luis Severino finished the year with a 2.98 earned run average (ERA). After disappointing 2016 campaigns for Judge and Severino, they were fabulous in 2017. Aaron Judge nearly won the 2017 MVP award, but did take home the American League Rookie of the year award. Luis Severino also nearly won the Cy Young award. As for Gary Sanchez, he proved that his short but dominate 2016 season was not a one hit wonder. The Yankees had themselves a great young core of players, with more to come.

            Going into the postseason there was lots excitement, the Yankees had to play a one game elimination game against the Minnesota Twins (Wild Card game). The winner of that game would advance to play the World Series favorite Cleveland Indians in a best of 5 American League Division Series (ALDS). The Yankees had their top young pitcher for the Wild Card game in Luis Severino, it seemed the Yankees would win this game with ease. The first batter of the game hit a home run; it was quickly 1-0 Twins. A few batters later the Twins had a 3-0 lead after a 2-run home run. Yankee fans were in shock, we thought our season was over 30 minutes into the first playoff game. Luis Severino was taken out of the game immediately, the Twins now seemed to be the favorite to win this do or die game. But the 2017 Yankees never quit, that was their energy all season. In the bottom of the 1st inning the Yankees quickly put 2 runners on base. Shortstop Didi Gregorius was batting representing the tying run. With fans on their feet hoping the seasons stays alive, Didi Gregorius hits a game tying 3-run Home Run, and the stadium went crazy. It was the biggest hit for the Yankees in about 5 years. The game was now tied 3-3. The Yankees went on to win the elimination game 8-4 and played the heavyweight Cleveland Indians in a best of 5 series.
